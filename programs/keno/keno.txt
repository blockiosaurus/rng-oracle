					$CRUMBS KENO

We want to develop tools & games for our community and the web3 ecosystem. 
While we build out our Brand, we would like to present $Crumbs Keno v1. 
$CK will be the first Crypto Keno game built on the Solana Platform. 

Games will be played once daily for the first week. This will allow us
to make any changes/fixes to the platform. Week 2, games will played twice
daily. Gametimes will be split with a 12hr. timespan to allow for all members  
to have a chance to play within thier timezone. Week 3 contiues with 3 games
daily, with an 8 hour timespan in between each game. We built our own server
to run $CK, so progression will be open as we continue to build.

Since this is V1 of our game, we are only allowing $Crumbs to be used at this
time. Our plan is allow our community members to play the game first and give
us feedback prior to offical launch. We will make an announcment when we are
ready to invite members to play. 4x $Crumbs will be allotted per Breadhead
HOLDER who registers to test the game. All $Crumbs holders will be allowed to
play. $Crumbs will be recieved if you win your game. 1 $Crumb = 1 $Crumb 

				    How To Play

Each Keno slip contains numbers 1-80.
Fill out KENO slip w/ the numbers/spots you want to play. (Max. 5 numbers)
Choose how many $Crumbs you want to risk
Tickets cannot be voided once approved! Please be sure to check your ticket.
A win occurs when some or all of your numbers (spots) are matched 

					Odds per 1x $Crumbs 
1 Spot Game - Match 1 = (x1) 
2 Spot Game - Match 2 = (x2)
3 Spot Game - Match 2 = (x1) Match 3 = (x5)
4 Spot Game - Match 2 = (x1) Match 3 = (x2) Match 4 = (x10)
5 Spot Game - Match 3 = (x1) Match 4 = (x3) Match 5 = (x30)
More Game spots will be added as we progress. 

When the game is ready to Launch, we plan on allowing other tokens/coins to be 
accepted for play. There will be some cost to run & maintain the game server, 
but all other proceeds will go to fund the BreadBox DAO. We believe this we go
along way in building our Brand and bringing value to ALL Genesis Breadheads. 
Stay tuned for more updates coming soon.
